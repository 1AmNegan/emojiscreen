# EmojiScreen ðŸ“º

## Contributing

Below are instructions for how to contribute to this project. The easiest way to make a contribution is to add a `Emoji Card` to the website. Each card should be added in the `data.json` file as an object. For more advanced ways to contribute, see the repo Issues. 

Read below for a detailed walkthrough on how to add an `Emoji Card` to this project. First time pull-requests are encouraged.

### Card Overview

On the website, each `Emoji Card` displays images of the emojis, a hint icon that will show the type (musical, movie or TV show) when the user hovers and the name of the show, which appears when the user clicks on a card.

In the code, each `Emoji Card` consists of the following JSON:

``` 
{
    "title": "The Lion King",
    "emojiImgs": [
        "nature/lion.png",
        "animated/crown.gif",
        "nature/cat.png"
    ],
    "genres": [
        "animation",
        "adventure",
        "drama"
    ],
    "type": "movie",
    "year": 1994
  }
```

To add a new card to the website, add a new JSON object in the `data.json` file. Make sure to separate your new object from existing objects with a comma.
